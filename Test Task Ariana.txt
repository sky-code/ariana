INTRODUCTORY TASK

Task: to develop a simple questionnaire system

The user should be able to have a simple dialog with the system and to go through predefined questions and answers.

Dialog example:

Are you hungry? (Yes/No)
   Yes:
       What would you like to eat? (Hamburger/Pizza/Pop Corn/Chicken)
           Hamburger:
               Nice, I will order a hamburger for you!
           Pizza:
               Would you like pizza with mushrooms? (Yes/No)
                   Yes:
                       Ok, I will order the best pizza in town for you
                   No:
                       No? Well... stay hungry then
   No:
       Ok. Call me when you're hungry.

The system consists of two parts: user app (frontend) and backend.

Frontend functionality:
1. Show questionnaires list (user can select what questionnaire he/she will pass)
2. Go through Q&A (show question and possible answers to the user)

Backend functionality:
1. Load questionnaires structure from JSON file
2. REST API for user app (questionnaires list)
3. When the conversation finished (last question answered) the backend should log the conversation history into the console. The log should contain the first question and all subsequent user answers. Example: `Are you hungry?: Yes -> Pizza -> Yes`

Limitations:
1. The server shouldn't return the whole dialog tree via one response. The system should be interactive (should load next question and answer variants only)
2. The number of answers associated with a question is limited to 5
3. The backend should be developed with python and django
4. The frontend can be developed in any modern framework (react, vue, angular)
